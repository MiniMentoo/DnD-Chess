# DnD-Chess
My experimentation with Javascript and Discord bots!

Little todolist
- Make a nice way to visualise hands
- Make decks for every type (spell, creature, items)
- (actually design a fun game maybe)

List of sins/optimisations
- for the draw-spell and similar files, I reread the deck every time I draw a card (really bad if decks get large)
