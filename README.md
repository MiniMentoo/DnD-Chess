# DnD-Chess
My experimentation with Javascript and Discord bots!

Little todolist
- Make decks for every type (spell, creature, items)
- (actually design a fun game maybe)

List of sins/optimisations
- user hands just store every card in the order gotten, irrespective of type, should idealy split into 3 different dictionaries, one for each type, and then count quantity of each card
